# gotodos

### Overview

This is a ToDo App built using a React frontend and a Go backend. The backend leverages the Fiber web framework for handling HTTP requests and uses SQLite as the database. Database migrations are managed with Dbmate, and SQLC is used to generate type-safe SQL queries.

### Technologies Used

#### Frontend:

React – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

#### Backend:

Go (Golang) – A statically typed, compiled programming language.
Fiber – A fast, lightweight web framework for Go.
SQLC – Generates Go code from SQL queries, enabling type safety and reducing boilerplate.
Dbmate – A database migration tool used to manage schema changes.
Database:
SQLite – A lightweight, file-based relational database.
